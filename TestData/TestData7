A suit includes a hard upper torso providing shoulder apertures. A repositionable scye bearing is arranged at a shoulder aperture. An adjustable shoulder device interconnects the scye bearing and the hard upper torso. The adjustable shoulder device is configured to move the scye bearing between first and second shoulder width positions relative to the hard upper torso. A method of donning a suit includes the steps of adjusting a scye bearing relative to a hard upper torso to a desired shoulder width position. The scye bearing can be subsequently repositioned for desired crewmember fit and use while the desired shoulder width position is maintained.
