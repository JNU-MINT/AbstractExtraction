It is the vision of the Public Transit Police Department to achieve a transit system free from crime and disorder. are designed to enhance safety, increase riders and preserve the quality of our system’s structure. 
　　Transit has its own police force committed to the safety of its customers and drivers, serving seven counties and 85 cities in the region. There are 23 full-time officers, 146 part-time officers and five administrative staff, devoted to one thing: public safety. 
　　You’ve probably seen Transit Police officers patrolling bus routes in cars or on foot. During visits with drivers, Transit Police either ride along or they step on board to greet drivers and passengers. Sometimes officers patrol out of uniform – one could be on your next bus. The fare inspectors on Hiawatha light-rail trains are Transit Police officers. 
　　Every new Public Transit bus has an onboard security camera. Videotapes from these cameras help Transit Police identify and charge criminals. 
　　Downtown patrols built up in early 2002 have improved the quality of life for downtown residents and transit customers. Ten full-time police officers are assigned to the Minneapolis and St. Paul downtown areas, to ensure public security. 
　　Downtown arrests have gone from 490 in April-September 2001 to 941 during the same period in 2002.
